# Path-Finder-using-A-star-Algorithm
Developed a 2D interactive application in Python implementing the A* algorithm for AI-based pathfinding.  • Users can designate blocked squares on a 2D map, with the algorithm identifying the optimal path from the start to  end square, avoiding all blocked areas.   • Technologies Used: Python, NumPy, PyGame.
